# ChatGPT Clone with Flutter

## About the Project

This project is a simple chat application developed with Flutter. It was originally designed to interface with OpenAI's ChatGPT API, but due to the API's cost, it was pivoted to use a local data array for responses, making it a joke-telling chatbot. This project serves as a learning journey for those interested in Flutter and mobile app development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter installed on your local machine. To check, run `flutter doctor` in your terminal.
- An IDE such as Android Studio or VS Code with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
- An emulator or physical device to run the app.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**`

3. **Get Flutter packages:**

   \```sh
   flutter pub get
   \```

4. **Open an emulator or connect a physical device.**

5. **Run the app:**

   \```sh
   flutter run
   \```

### Usage

Once you've started the app, you can interact with the chatbot by typing messages into the chat input. The chatbot will respond with a random joke from its local dataset.

## Learning Journey

The development of this app provided an opportunity to learn various Flutter concepts, including state management, working with lists, and user input handling. Initially intended to be a ChatGPT API consumer, the project was adapted to avoid the associated costs, demonstrating the importance of flexibility and problem-solving in software development.
